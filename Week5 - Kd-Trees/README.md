# **Kd-Trees** 

Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point).  

**PointSET** implements the data type by Brute-force methods.  
**KdTree** uses a 2d-tree to implement the class so that it is more efficient.
