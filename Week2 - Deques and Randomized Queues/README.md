# **Deques and Randomized Queues** 

Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.   

The implementation of **Deque** uses a double-linked list.  
The implementation of **RandomizedQueue** uses a resizing array.  
The **Permutation** uses a **StringBuilder** object to read in a sequence of strings. Then it enqueues selected strings and traverses them. I've got a bonus here because of using only one **RandomizedQueue** object of maximum size at most k.
